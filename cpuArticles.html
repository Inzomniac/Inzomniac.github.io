				<h1>Intel 4004: 1971</h1>
				<p>
					The first microprocessor in history, Intel 4004
					was a 4-bit CPU designed for usage in
					calculators, or, as we say now, designed
					for "embedded applications". Clocked at 740 KHz,
					the 4004 executed up to 92,000 single word
					instructions per second, could access 4 KB of
					program memory and 640 bytes of RAM. Although the
					Intel 4004 was perfect fit for calculators and
					similar applications it was not very suitable for
					microcomputer use due to its somewhat limited
					architecture. The 4004 lacked interrupt support,
					had only 3-level deep stack, and used complicated
					method of accessing the RAM. Some of these
					shortcomings were fixed in the 4004 successor -
					Intel 4040.

				<h1>Intel 8008: 1972</h1>
				<p>
					The first 8-bit microprocessor, Intel 8008 was
					released 5 months after Intel 4004
					microprocessor. The 8008 was available in two
					speed grades - 500 KHz and 800 KHz, but even the
					faster version 8008-1 was running a bit slower
					(in instructions per second) than the 4004.
					Nevertheless, overall performance of the 8008 was
					greater due to 8-bit architecture. The 8008 had
					other advantages over the 4004:
					<br>
					Support of 16 KB of memory (ROM and RAM combined).
					Deeper stack: 7 levels instead of 3 levels.
					Interrupt capability.
					<br>
					One of the drawbacks of the Intel 8008 was the
					absence of direct memory addressing. To access
					data in memory the memory address had to be
					stored in H and L registers, and only then the
					processor could indirectly access the memory.
					This limitation was removed in Intel 8080.

					Intel made the new microprocessor source code
					compatible with the 8008. Interrupt processing
					logic didn't change from the 8008, which also
					helped to port old software to the 8080
					processor. The 8080 processor included many
					enhancements:
					<br>
					Maximum memory size was expanded to 64 KB.
					Stack size was no longer limited to 7 levels.
					The number of I/O ports was increased to 256.

				<h1>Motorola 6800</h1>
				<p>
					Motorola 6800 is a 8-bit microprocessor which was released at about the same time as Intel 8080.
					The 6800 had 16-bit address bus and could address up to 64 KB of memory. From common registers the CPU had only two accumulators and one index register.
					The 6800 didn't have I/O instructions and therefore 6800-based systems had to use memory-mapped I/O for input/output capabilities.
					Motorola 6800 started the big family of 680x microcontrolers and microprocessors, some of which are still produced today.

				<h1>Texas Instruments TMS1000: 1974</h1>
				<p>
					Texas Instruments TMS1000 family of 4-bit microcontrollers was introduced in 1974. The TMS 1000 microcontrollers had very simple design - only 2 4-bit general registers, 43 instructions (expanded to 54 instructions in TMS1100/TMS1300), 1-level deep stack, shift-register program counter and no interrupts.
					The TMS1000/TMS1070 were basic microcontrollers with 1 KB of masked ROM and 64 x 4 bits of RAM. ROM and RAM memory size was doubled on TMS1100 microcontrollers. TMS1200/TMS1270/TMS1300 microcontrollers were similar to TMS1000/TMS1070/TMS1100 respectively, but had more output lines. The TMS1070 and TMS1270 could directly interface to high voltage displays.

				<h1>Intel 8086: 1978</h1>
				<p>
					Intel 8086 microprocessor is a first member of
					x86 family of processors. Advertised as a "source-
					code compatible" with Intel 8080 and Intel 8085
					processors, the 8086 was not object code
					compatible with them. The 8086 had complete 16-
					bit architecture - 16-bit internal registers, 16-
					bit data bus, and 20-bit address bus (1 MB of
					physical memory). Because the processor had 16-
					bit index registers and memory pointers, it could
					effectively address only 64 KB of memory. To
					address memory beyond 64 KB the Intel 8086 used
					segment registers - these registers specified
					where code, stack data and extra data 64 KB
					segments are located within 1 MB of total
					processor memory. To accommodate this awkward
					memory addressing many 8086 compilers included 6
					different memory models: tiny, small, compact,
					medium, large and huge. 64 KB direct addressing
					limitation went away with the introduction of the
					32-bit protected mode in Intel 80386 processor.

					This is the best looking, and by far most rare
					package for the 8086.

				<h1>Intel 8088: 1979</h1>
				<p>
					Intel 8088 microprocessor is almost identical to
					the Intel 8086 processor with the exception of
					the external data bus. External data bus width of
					the 8088 was reduced to 8 bits, and instruction
					queue size and prefetching algorithms were
					changed. Intel 8088 used two consecutive bus
					cycles to write or read 16 bit data instead of
					one cycle for the 8086. This made the processor
					to run slower, but on the plus side the hardware
					changes in the 8088 CPU made it compatible with
					8080/8085 peripherals.

					Architecture of the 8088 stayed the same as the
					8086: 16-bit registers, 16-bit internal data bus
					and 20-bit address bus, which allowed the
					processor address up to 1 MB of memory. The 8088
					had the same segmented memory addressing as the
					8086: the processor could address 64 KB of memory
					directly, and to address more than 64 KB of
					memory one of special segment registers had to be
					updated.

				<h1>Motorola 68000: 1979</h1>
				<p>
					The Motorola 68000 is a 16/32-bit complex instruction set computer (CISC) microprocessor, 
					in 1979 by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector.
					The design implements a 32-bit instruction set, with 32-bit registers and a 16-bit internal data bus.
					The address bus is 24 bits and does not use memory segmentation, which made it easier to program for. Internally, it uses a 16-bit data arithmetic logic unit and two more 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses,
					and has a 16-bit external data bus. For this reason, Motorola termed it a 16/32-bit processor.
					As one of the first widely available processors with a 32-bit instruction set, and running at relatively high speeds for the era, the 68k was a popular design through the 1980s.
					It was widely used in a new generation of personal computers with graphical user interfaces, including the Macintosh, Amiga, Atari ST, and X68000. The 1988 Mega Drive console is also powered by a 68000.

					The 68000 was followed by additional processors implementing full 32-bit ALUs as part of the growing Motorola 68000 series.
					The original 68k is generally software forward-compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus.

				<h1>Intel Pentium: 1993</h1>
				<p>
					The Pentium (or P5) was the next in the line of
					Intel x86 CPUs. The class of CPUs is known as
					8050x, or Pentiums. Intel was going away from
					branding CPUs as numbers (486 etc) as it was
					ruled that Intel couldn't copyright numbers.
					<br>
					The Pentium has 16K of Cache (32k in MMX chips)
					and could address 4GB of memory. In essence
					it was 2 486s side by side. It was made in speeds
					from 60MHz-300MHz, voltages from 1.8 (mobile) to
					5.15V (origial Pentium).
					<br>
					There are several Flavors of the Pentium:
					P5: Original 5V Socket 4
					P54C: Socket 5/7 3.3V
					P55C: Socket 7 Split Voltage 0.35u MMX
					<br>
					The early Pentiums had a bug called the FDIV Bug,
					that under certain conditions would result in
					faulty math. It was a PR nightmare and was fixed.
					<br>
					------------------------<br>
					Type: P5<br>
					MMX: No<br>
					FDIV Bug: Yes<br>
					------------------------<br>
					<br>
					This was a very early version without the heat
					plate.

				<h1>Intel Pentium II(2): 1997</h1>
				<p>
					The Pentium II is the second of the P6 series.
					The Pentium Pro was first. The PII includes
					MMX instructions and fixes the slow 16-bit
					performance of the Pentium Pro. It also marked
					a transition away from socketed CPUs. As in the
					PPRO, the 512K cache is seperate from the CPU dies, but instead of including it in the same
					cavity Intel chose to integrate it on a PCB.
					This allowed them to use commercial (cheaper)
					cache chips. With this though the cache ran at
					1/2 CPU speed.
					<br>
					The PII was originally made on a 0.35u process
					but transistioned to a much better 0.25u process.
					<br>
					The PII also saw the introduction of a 100MHz Bus
					with the 350MHz and 400MHz CPUs.
					<br><br>
					--------------<br>
					80522 = 0.35u (Klamath)<br>
					80523 = 0.25u (Deschutes)<br>

					in Oregon<br>

				<h1>AMD-K5 PR100: 1994</h1>
				<p>
					Of all the x86 processors announced, AMD's is the
					most architecturally interesting, diverging
					radically from the approach taken by Pentium's
					designers. At its heart, the K5 isn't an Intel-
					compatible chip at all - it's a RISC processor
					somewhat akin to AMD's superscalar AM29000 chips.
					However the RISC core and its instruction set
					(called ROPs - pronounced ar-ops)is hidden from
					the end user. Instead, x86 instructions are
					converted into these RISC operations which are
					then handled by six parallel execution units:
					one floating point unit, two integer units, two
					load/store units and a branch unit. It is an
					approach similar to NexGen's Nx586, however AMD
					has included some extra technology at the
					beginning of the translation process, which the
					company claims will allow up to four x86
					instructions to be despatched concurrently.
					This is pushing it a bit, since only the very
					simplest x86 instructions will map directly onto
					an ROP. "Simplest" in this case, equates to instructions such as register-to-register adds.
					Most operations take two or three.
					<br>
					The K5 was Pentium Rated (PR) to how fast of a
					Pentium it was equivalent to.

				<h1>AMD-K6 200ALR: 1997</h1>
				<p>
					The K6 was based on the Nexgen 686. AMD bought
					Nexgen and used there RISC86 core which allowed
					much higher speeds then the old K5 core.
					<br>
					K6's were made on 0.35 micron process originally
					and then moved to 0.25 micron in 1998.
					For a while AMD used a PR rating to equate
					the K6 to the Pentium II, but since the PR was
					the same as the actual speed, it was dropped.
					<br>
					This is a 0.35 micron part.
					<br>

				<h1>Intel Pentium III(3): 1999</h1>
				<p>
					The Pentium III is the third in the P6 family.
					It includes some enhancements over the PII.
					It has SSE which is additional intructions
					for working on multimedia code.
					<br>
						SSE = Streaming SIMD Extentions<br>
						SIMD = Single Instruction Multiple Data<br>
					<br>
					Several versions of the PIII were made:<br>
						80525 PIII Katmai - 0.25 Micron Cache offchip<br>
						80526 PIII Coppermine - 0.18 Micron 256K of cache integrated on the die<br>
						PIII Mobile - Low voltage PIII with on die cache<br>
						80530 PIII Tualatin - 512k Cache on Die and voltages<br>
					<br>
					The Coppermine was available in both the SECC2
					package and a Sooket 370 FCPGA
					Tualatins were a modified Socket 370 called Socket T.
					<br>
					Pentium III CPUs spaned 1000MHz of speed (400
					-1400). and were great performers. a P3 1400
					will outperform a P4 2GHz.<br>
